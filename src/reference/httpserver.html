					<p>
						Nginious is a full featured HTTP server built on top of an asynchronous I/O engine. This makes it
						scale to many simultaneous connections. It supports all versions of the HTTP protocol from HTTP/0.9
						to HTTP/1.1. All features of the HTTP/1.1 protocol are supported except for multi range requests.
						For detailed information about which HTTP protocol features are supported by Nginious see section
						<a href="httpserver.html#details">4.4 Feature details</a>.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="start"></a>4.2. Starting and stopping</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						The server is started by executing <code>bin/start.sh</code> from the base directory or by
						executing <code>java -jar libs/nginious-server-1.0.0.jar</code> from the base directory. A list
						of possible command line options is found below.

						Nginous provides two log files which can both be found in the <code>logs</code> subdirectory. The first
						log is a general log where Nginious logs information about its actions and any errors and warnings that
						might occur. This log is named <code>server.log</code>. The second log is a HTTP request log where
						information about each HTTP request is logged in the combined log format. This log is named 
						<code>access.log</code>. Both logs are rotated on a daily basis. A history of up to 10 days is kept.
