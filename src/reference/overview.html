					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="server"></a>2.1. HTTP server</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious implements a full featured HTTP server on top of an asynchronous I/O engine. It
						supports HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 (all features except multi ranges). The asynchronous
						I/O engine enables the HTTP server to scale to many simultaneous connections and also
						enables the server to support long lived connections.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="webapps"></a>2.2. Web applications</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Developers write HTTP services to implement web based applications in Nginious.
						These are packaged together with static content into web applications in a similar
						way as in servlet based HTTP containers. See the <a	href="api/com/nginious/http/HttpService.html">
						HttpService</a> class for detailed information about HTTP services.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="websockets"></a>2.3. Web sockets</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Support for web sockets. Developers write web socket services to implement
						behaviour. These are packaged together with HTTP services and static content
						into web applications. See the <a href="api/com/nginious/http/websocket/WebSocketService.html">
						WebSocketService</a> class for detailed information about web socket services.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="rest"></a>2.4. RESTful services</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious provides support for REST based services. JSON or XML content sent to
						REST services is automatically deserialized into beans and result beans from services
						is automatically serialized into JSON or XML content. Serialization and
						deserialization is done based on the values of <code>Content-Type</code> and
						<code>Accept</code> headers. See the <a href="api/com/nginious/http/websocket/WebSocketService.html">
						RestService</a> class for detailed information about REST services.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="xsp"></a>2.5. XSP</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						XSP is a template language for generating HTML pages from dynamic content. Pages
						are translated directly into HttpService classes using bytecode translation. The
						javac compiler is not used. This makes the translation very fast and makes it
						possible for developers to make changes and reload pages in their browser to view
						changes almost instantly.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="multipart"></a>2.6. Multipart content</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						The HTTP server has built in support for handling multipart content. It also exposes
						an API to developers making it easy to develop web applications with support for file
						uploads. The API makes it possible to develop functionality for tracking the
						progress of file uploads.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="eclipse"></a>2.7. Eclipse plugin</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious is integrated with Eclipse through a plugin which makes it possible to run
						the Nginious server inside Eclipse. The plugin also provides special project
						layouts and wizards for creating Nginious projects.					
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="deployment"></a>2.8. Server administration</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious provides REST based services for deploying web applications to a remote
						server. This is done as a multipart upload to a specific admin URL.
						Nginious servers keep up to 10 versions of a deployed web application. A
						web application can be rolled back to the previous version if problems or
						errors are discovered with the latest deployed version.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="reloading"></a>2.9. Resource reloading</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						At the heart of Nginious is a flexible resource reloading mechanism which consists
						of a dynamic class loader and several other mechanisms to reload XSP templates and
						HTTP services. If a class, jar file or XSP template is updated it is automatically
						reloaded without the need to restart Nginious or redeploy web applications. This
						together with the Eclipse plugin provides a powerful development environment with
						almost no wait time between code changes and update in Nginious.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="ant"></a>2.10. Ant integration</h2></div>
						
					<p>
						Two ant tasks are provided. One for compiling XSP templates into HTTP service classes
						and one for deploying web applications to a remote Nginious server.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="session"></a>2.11. Session management</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Two HTTP session management strategies are provided. In-memory sessions which uses
						a tracking cookie to identify sessions. The other option is cookie based session
						which serializes the sessions contents into a cookie.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="statistics"></a>2.12. Statistics</h2></div>
											
					<p>
						Nginious tracks basic HTTP request and web socket session statistics per minnute.
						Statistics information can be accessed over HTTP from Nginious servers.
