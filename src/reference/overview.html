					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="server"></a>2.1. HTTP server</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious implements a full featured HTTP server on top of an asynchronous I/O engine. It
						supports HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 (all features except multi ranges). The asynchronous
						I/O engine enables the HTTP server to scale to many simultaneous connections and also
						enables the server to support long lived connections.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="webapps"></a>2.2. Web applications</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Developers write controllers to implement web based applications in Nginious.
						These are packaged together with static content into web applications in a similar
						way as in servlet based HTTP containers. A controller is a Java class which is
						annotated with the <a href="api/com/nginious/http/annotation/Controller.html">Controller</a>
						and <a href="api/com/nginious/http/annotation/Request.html">Request</a> annotations.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="websockets"></a>2.3. Web sockets</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Support for web sockets. Developers write web socket controllers to implement
						behavior. These are packaged together with static content into web applications. 
						See the <a href="api/com/nginious/http/annotation/Controller.html">Controller</a> and
						<a href="api/com/nginious/http/annotation/Message.html">Message</a> annotations.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="rest"></a>2.4. RESTful controllers</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious provides support for REST based controller. JSON or XML content sent to
						REST controllers is automatically deserialized into beans and result beans from controllers
						is automatically serialized into JSON or XML content. Serialization and
						deserialization is done based on the values of <code>Content-Type</code> and
						<code>Accept</code> headers.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="services"></a>2.5. Services</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Services publish an API or run background services in a separate thread in a web application. Controllers can access services
						by declaring them in its methods. See the <a href="api/com/nginious/http/annotation/Service.html">Service</a>
						annotation for information about how to declare a Java class as a service.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="xsp"></a>2.6. XSP</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						XSP is a template language for generating HTML pages from dynamic content. Pages
						are translated directly into classes using bytecode translation. The javac compiler 
						is not used. This makes the translation very fast and makes it possible for developers 
						to make changes and reload pages in their browser to view changes almost instantly.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="multipart"></a>2.7. Multipart content</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						The HTTP server has built in support for handling multipart content. It also exposes
						an API to developers making it easy to develop web applications with support for file
						uploads. The API makes it possible to develop functionality for tracking the
						progress of file uploads.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="eclipse"></a>2.8. Eclipse plugin</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious is integrated with Eclipse through a plugin which makes it possible to run
						the Nginious server inside Eclipse. The plugin also provides special project
						layouts and wizards for creating Nginious projects.					
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="deployment"></a>2.9. Server administration</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Nginious provides REST based services for deploying web applications to a remote
						server. This is done as a multipart upload to a specific admin URL.
						Nginious servers keep up to 10 versions of a deployed web application. A
						web application can be rolled back to the previous version if problems or
						errors are discovered with the latest deployed version.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="reloading"></a>2.10. Resource reloading</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						At the heart of Nginious is a flexible resource reloading mechanism which consists
						of a dynamic class loader and several other mechanisms to reload XSP templates and
						controllers. If a class, jar file or XSP template is modified it is automatically
						reloaded without the need to restart Nginious or redeploy web applications. This
						together with the Eclipse plugin provides a powerful development environment with
						almost no wait time between code changes and updates in Nginious.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="ant"></a>2.11. Ant integration</h2></div>
						
					<p>
						Two ant tasks are provided. One for compiling XSP templates into Java classes
						and one for deploying web applications to a remote Nginious server.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="session"></a>2.12. Session management</h2></div>
					
					<p>
						Two HTTP session management strategies are provided. In-memory sessions which uses
						a tracking cookie to identify sessions. The other option is cookie based session
						which serializes the sessions contents into a cookie.
					</p>
					
					<div><h2 class="title"><a name="statistics"></a>2.13. Statistics</h2></div>
											
					<p>
						Nginious tracks basic HTTP request and web socket session statistics per minute.
						Statistics information can be accessed over HTTP from Nginious servers.
